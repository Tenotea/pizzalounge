# Answers
- `How do you document your frontend code?`
  
  > **I document my frontend code using storybook**


- `What are your thoughts on testing for the front-end?`
   > Personally I don't buy the idea of some integrated tests on the frontend. Some tests end up becoming unnecessarily redundant. End-to-end tests are where my preference lie. They are much more relevant as well as their feedbacks.
- `What Design Patterns have you used in your frontend projects?`
  > Atomic Design Pattern
- `What do you think about Typescript on the front-end?`
  > Typescript should become the standard for all js applications. That's just how useful I find it. Typescript to a large extent reduces runtime bugs on the frontend which really slaps harder on user experience. 
- `What are the most important performance issues in React web applications?`
  > - Rendering too many react components at once which could easily be solved using react lazy-loading
  >  - Inefficient algorithms on the frontend that ends up consuming too much user memory.
  > - Pushing some of the heavy load that can be handled on the backend to the frontend as well as pulling in and attempting to render too much information on the frontend

- `How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?`
  > I paid more attention to how each piece of my application would work in other usecases other than the present one. 
- `Are there any improvements you could make to your submission`
  > - A lot! First I'll start by completing the functionalities of the website.
  > - Next I'll make each page responsive
